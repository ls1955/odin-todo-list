# Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-todo-list). Perhaps give this [project](https://ls1955.github.io/odin-todo-list/) a look?

# Improvement?
* For better or for worse (probably the latter), everything inside the project
is written without 'class' or module. Instead, everything is plain object.

* There are a lot of template inside dist/index.html, author is currently unclear
whether all the HTML elements is supposed to be generate solely by JS. Will
definitely have a look at others' project.

* The page looks like a bare and fresh generated Rails app, perhaps include some styles?
